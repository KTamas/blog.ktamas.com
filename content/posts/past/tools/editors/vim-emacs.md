<blockquote>
  <p>Ovid: Hey, I just wanted you to know that I think I'm the one who put in the full URLs in the ad server stuff, so I can't blame Marshall for that :)</p>
  <p>Theory: Oh, okay.</p>
  <p>Ovid: Yeah, it was bugging me, but I dimly remember doing that because we had no idea if [guilty party] would change their ads again. I should have pulled that into a variable, but vim makes bulk editing soooo easy.</p>
  <p>Ovid: (Which is a bad lazy)</p>
  <p>Theory: Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
  <p>Theory: <code>vim&#x002d;&#x002d;</code></p>
  <p>Ovid: <code>((emacs)&#x002d;&#x002d;)</code></p>
  <p>Theory: ROTFL</p>
  <p>Theory: I'm going to blog that.</p>
  <p>Ovid: :)</p>
