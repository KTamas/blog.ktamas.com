<p><strong>HOLY SHIT!</strong></p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/08/bulge/" title="Bush's mystery bulge">story</a> in <a href="http://www.salon.com/" title="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>, it appears that George W. Bush may well have been wearing a radio transmitter during the first debate. This would be so that he could get prompts from someone more knowledgeable (Dick Cheney?).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/" title="See the current electoral vote status of the campaign on a nice colored map">Current Electoral Vote Predictor</a> (which currently shows Kerry leading 280 to 239!) has confirmed the presence of <q>the bulge</q> with <a href="http://www.electoral-vote2.com/images/bulge.jpg" title="The Electoral Vote Predictor's enhanced image of the bulge">this image</a>, using Red Hawk image intensification software.</p>

<p>My favorite phrase from the Salon.com article: the <q>Milli Vanilli president.</q></p>
