<p>I can't believe I haven't posted this story here yet! I guess I've been busy. So here it is:</p>

<p><cite>eWeek</cite> has <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1627959,00.asp" title="Read the review">reviewed</a> <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/" title="Visit the Bricolage Website">Bricolage</a>, the Perl-powered, PostgreSQL-backed open-source content management system. The article was published last week. An excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bricolage is quite possibly the most capable enterprise-class open-source application available. The Web content management application features excellent administration capabilities, and it is highly extensible and capable of managing even the biggest and most complex Web sites. As an open-source product, Bricolage is free, and companies can now purchase support and development services from Kineticode.</p></blockquote>

<p>The article is part of the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1627957,00.asp"title="Content Management Face-Off"><q>Content Management Face-Off</q></a> in the current issue of <cite>eWeek</cite>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Included in this evaluation are the open-source Bricolage 1.8.1, Interwoven Inc.'s TeamSite 6.1, CrownPeak Technology Inc.'s Advantage CMS, Serena Software Inc.'s Collage 4.5, PaperThin Inc.'s CommonSpot Content Server 4.0 and Ektron Inc.'s CMS300 4.5. (The reviews are ordered, roughly, from the high end to the low end of the content management market.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm pretty stoked about this review, as you might imagine. <cite>eWeek</cite> is now officially my favorite trade magazine!</p>
