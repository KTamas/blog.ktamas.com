<p>We spent seven weeks last summer <a href="http://www.justatheory.com/travel/france/2012/a-rouen.html">in Northern France</a>. Man it was an awesome time. None of us wanted to leave! Well, almost true. The thing about Normandy is that the weather is very much like Portland—except that <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Juneuary">Juneuary</a> lasts through July and August. We were so desperate for sun that we spent a week <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/sets/72157630781097042/">in Barcelona</a>.</p>

<p>This summer will be different. Much warmer. No, not Portland, but two months in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles">Arles</a>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence">Provence</a>. Yes, we are once again doing a home exchange, this time in the city in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a> famously spent his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh#Artistic_breakthrough_and_final_years">final years</a>. Nice, warm, Mediterranean weather.</p>

<p>We can’t wait.</p>
