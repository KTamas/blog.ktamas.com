C'est mois, in the first of a series for the [iovation blog](https://www.iovation.com/blog):

> Given our commitment to responsible data stewardship, as well as the
> invalidation of [Safe Harbor] and the advent of the [GDPR], we saw an
> opportunity to reduce these modest but very real risks without impacting the
> efficacy of our services. A number of methodologies for data protection exist,
> including encryption, strict access control, and tokenization. We undertook
> the daunting task to determine which approaches best address data privacy
> compliance requirements and work best to protect customers and users — without
> unacceptable impact on service performance, cost to maintain infrastructure,
> or loss of product usability.

The post covers encryption, access control, and tokenization.
