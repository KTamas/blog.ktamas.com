Elizabeth Warren describes [what she saw] in the immigration camps near McAllen,
Texas, this past Sunday:

> At the time of separation, most of the mothers were told their children would
> be back. One woman had been held at “the icebox,” a center that has earned its
> nickname for being extremely cold. When the agent came to take her child, she
> was told that it was just too cold for the child in the center, and that they
> were just going to keep the child warm until she was transferred. That was
> mid-June. She hasn’t seen her child since.
>
> One mother had been detained with her child. They were sleeping together on
> the floor of one of the cages, when, at 3:00am, the guards took her away. She
> last saw her 7-year-old son sleeping on the floor. She cried over and over, “I
> never got to say goodbye. I never got to say goodbye.” That was early-June,
> and she hasn’t seen him since.

There's no other way to put it: The Trump administration's immigration policies
are a humanitarian crime. The people who implemented it should be prosecuted for
human rights violations.
