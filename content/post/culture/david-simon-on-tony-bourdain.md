David Simon, pitch-perfect as usual, on his friend [Tony]:

> Go, move, see, feel, eat – grow.  The Church of Bourdain was founded not
> merely on the ever-more-vulnerable national credo that all Americans are
> created equal, but on the much more ambitious insistence that this declaration
> might be applied wherever you wandered and with whomsoever you cooked or
> shared a meal.  He remains, for many of us, the American that we wish
> ourselves to be in the world’s sight. To have him widely displayed as our
> countryman, open to and caring about the rest of the world, and being so amid
> our current political degradation — this was ever more important and heroic.
> To lose him now, amid so many fear-mongering, xenophobic tantrums by those
> engaged in our misrule, is hideous and grievous.
> 
> But make no mistake: It wasn’t love of food that led Bourdain to the embrace
> of a shared human experience, of a world merely hiding its great commonalities
> behind vast and obvious culinary variations. It was the other way around. Tony
> was intensely political, a man always aware of those at the margins, or those
> who seem never to be reached by wealth or status or recognition.

Don't miss the Kissinger story.
