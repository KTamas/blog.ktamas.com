<li>Set up a simple <a href="http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/">Blosxom</a>-powered blog on the advice of a <a href="http://raelity.org/">friend who wrote it</a></li>
<li>Never bother to make it anything other than a CGI script that crawls your file system on every request</li>
<li>Add a bunch of plugins for various doodads and useless doohickies, also executing a bunch of crap on every request</li>
<li>Put it on your eight year old Dell Dimension running Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>In your basement</li>
<li>On your residential Comcast connection</li>
<li>Let many years go by, giving it very little attention</li>
<li>Write something interesting</li>
<li>Laugh about your complete inability to connect to the box from work while <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/29/conde-nast">Daring Fireball melts your connection</a></li>
</ul>
