The Bricolage project has a [new server]! Thanks to a generous donation from
[NetStumbler.com], we have a shiny new hosted FreeBSD server. I've started
building it, and have migrated the Bricolage Web site over today. By tomorrow,
DNS records should be updated, and it'll be rarin' to go!

While I was at it, I rolled out the new Bricolage API documentation browser.
There are now browser available for all of the major stable releases of
Bricolage, listed on the old [documentation page]. The API browser for the
current stable release will always be available [here]. Meanwhile, the
documentation will also be generated from the Subversion trunk every morning;
you can find those docs [here][1].

We'll also be able to keep better track of the kind of traffic the site gets
thanks to the new [stats site], which will also be updated daily.

Enjoy!
