[*Perl.com*] has published the first in a series of articles I've promised to
write, [“Content Management with Bricolage.”] The article is targeted at
organizational decision makers who need to evaluate Bricolage as part of their
selection of a content management solution. So I've spent some time discussing
what content management is and how Bricolage fits in. I mention a lot of other
CMSes as for comparative purposes, to try to really give people a feel for how
Bricolage can meet their needs.

I also go over some of Bricolage's most important features, such as multisite
management, document modeling, Perl templating, meaningful URLs, workflow, and
any number of outputs via “output channels.” The article concludes with a list
of sites known to be managed by Bricolage, as well as the promise for more.

The next article in the series will cover installation and configuration.
Subsequent articles will cover document analysis and modeling, [Mason]
templating, and fun with the SOAP server. Enjoy!
