<p><a href="http://pginstaller.projects.postgresql.org/faq/FAQ_windows.html#2.6" title="PostgreSQL Windows FAQ: Why can't I select Unicode as an encoding?">This just blows</a>. It will be a while before Bricolage runs on Windows, then. The PostgreSQL team is understandably reluctant to simply include the whole ICU library in PostgreSQL. Maybe it could be compiled into the binaries, though?</p>
