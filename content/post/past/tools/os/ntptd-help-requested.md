<p>So I need simple instructions to get NTPD running on FreeBSD. It should
function solely as a client, and not accept connections from other servers. I
could also use the corresponding instructions for Linux (and don't
say <q>RPM</q>!). I've found an awful lot of information online about NTPD,
but the simple instructions for setting up a secure NTPD to start when the
system starts up are sorely lacking. Part of the problem with regards to BSD
may be my not yet fully understanding how FreeBSD startup stuff is supposed to
work, but I also can't find simple instructions for how to configure ntptd to
operate only as a client.</p>

<p>Links and instructions gladly accepted.</p>
