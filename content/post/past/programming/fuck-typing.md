chromatic's [post on Perl Roles] reminded me that I've wanted for some time to
blog about another kind of composition. I call it “fuck typing.” It's kind of
like [duck typing], only not really. I would explain, but I think that my good
friend, Mr. Vinnie Goombatz, will do a much better job. Although if you're
squeamish or easily offended, you might want to skip it.

What's surprising to me is how accepted this sort of bad behavior is in some
[communities]. Oh, well, there are all kinds, I guess.
