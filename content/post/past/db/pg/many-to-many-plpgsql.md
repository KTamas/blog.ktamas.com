The second in my series of articles on programming PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL,
“Managing Many-to-Many Relationships with PL/pgSQL”, has just been published
[onLamp.com]. The idea is to abstract out of the application layer the
management of the many-to-many relationships, moving it into the database layer
where execution is both safer and faster. And you can learn more about PL/pgSQL
along the way.

So what are you waiting for? [Check it out]!
