<p>No Perl content today, I'm afraid. I'm just back from my trip to Japan and wanted to post this very nice video of my talk [Update 2018: Sadly gone now]. Unlike the versions from other conferences, this one focuses primarily on the slides, with me appearing in audio only. This makes it really easy to follow. Enjoy.</p>
