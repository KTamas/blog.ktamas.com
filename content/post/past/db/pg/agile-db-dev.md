I gave a tutorial at [PGCon] a couple weeks back, entitled “[Agile Database
Development] with Git, Sqitch, and pgTAP.” It went well, I think. The Keynote
document and an exported PDF have been [posted on PGCon.org][Agile Database
Development], and also uploaded to [Speaker Deck]. And embedded below, too. Want
to follow along? Clone the [tutorial Git repository] and follow along. Here’s
the teaser:

> Hi, I’m David. I like to write database apps. Just as much as I like to write
> web apps. (Maybe more!) How? Not by relying on bolted-on, half-baked database
> integration tools like migrations, I’ll tell you that!. Instead, I make
> extensive use of best-of-breed tools for source control ([Git]), database unit
> testing ([pgTAP]), and database change management and deployment ([Sqitch]).
> If you’d like to get as much pleasure out of database development as you do
> application development, join me for this tutorial. We’ll develop a sample
> application using the processes and tools I’ve come to depend on, and you’ll
> find out whether they might work for you. Either way, I promise it will at
> least be an amusing use of your time.
