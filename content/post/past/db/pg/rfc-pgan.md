I've posted a [plan to implement PGAN], a CPAN for PostgreSQL extensions. I've
tried to closely follow the [CPAN philosophy] to come up with a plan that
requires a minimum-work implementation that builds on the existing PostgreSQL
tools and the examples of [the CPAN] and [JSAN]. My hope is that itâ€™s full of
[JFDI]! I would be very grateful for feedback and suggestions.
