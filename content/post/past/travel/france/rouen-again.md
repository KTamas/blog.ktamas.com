<p>A few years back, we spent six weeks in Rouen, France. I <a href="/travel/france/">blogged about it a little</a> and took <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/tags/france/">a lot of photos</a>. It was a terrific experience, and we always knew we wanted to do it again. So you can imagine our delight at being asked to swap houses with the same folks again. Last time it was late November to early January: cold, cold, cold. This time, though, it will be the middle of summer. We leave mid-June and will return in early August. Seven weeks of awesomeness. Can't wait.</p>
