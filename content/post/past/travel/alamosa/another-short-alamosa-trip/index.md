I made another brief trip to Alamosa last week. This is the first chance I've
had to writ anything about it! I was doing two days of training for Adams State
College, where they're implementing a campus-wide content management solution
built on Bricolage. But the real reason I'm writing is because of the neat
photos I took. Most of them I took from the plane on the way in to Alamosa. But
the photo of the lobby of the Clarion hotel I stayed in is, um, *interesting* as
well. Enjoy!
