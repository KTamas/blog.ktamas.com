<p>Following up on my <a href="/computers/policy/ipod_security_threat.html" title="Gartner: iPod is a Security Threat">screed</a> against the idea of the <q>iPod security threat</q>, <a href="http://x180.net/" title="x180.net">James Duncan Davidson</a> sent me a link to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/07/13/britain.mod.reut/index.html" title="UK military: iPod is security risk" />this story</a> about how the UK military has decided that the iPod is a security threat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><q>With USB devices, if you plug it straight into the computer you can
  bypass passwords and get right on the system,</q> RAF Wing Commander Peter
  D'Ardenne told Reuters.</p>

  <p><q>That's why we had to plug that gap,</q> he said, adding that the
  policy was put into effect when the MoD switched to the USB-friendly
  Microsoft XP operating system over the past year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh. Do you mean to tell me that if you plug into the USB port of a PC that
no one is logged in to, you can get access to the contents of the PC without
logging in? You know, that sounds more like a <em>Windows</em> security flaw
than an iPod problem. I mean, it's reasonable for the military to ban external
media in order to prevent their personnel and contractors from copying
sensitive data onto personal devices for unknown purposes. But this Windows
security hole seems, well, <em>huge</em>.</p>

<p>And the truth is that these articles that single out the iPod as a security
threat are being disingenuous, in that it's much easier and much cheaper to use
a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001F21IS/justatheory-20" title="Buy a USB Flash Drive from Amazon">USB Flash Drive</a>. Furthermore, this
banning of storage devices really only keeps honest people honest; those who
really want to copy sensitive information to take home will figure out a way to
do it if they're motivated enough.</p>

<p>So yeah, highly sensitive security establishments <em>should</em> ban personal
external storage devices to keep honest people honest, but really, they should
also fix the real security problem with their operating system of choice.</p>
