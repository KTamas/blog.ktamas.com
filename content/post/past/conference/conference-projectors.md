I'm at [ETech], where there have been some great presentations. But during his
keynote this morning, Jon Udell momentarily had a problem where the window he
was using was larger than his screen real estate. And this reminded me of one of
my pet peeves.

*Why the hell do conference projectors **still** support a resolution of no more
than 800 x 600?!* There is simply no excuse for this anymore--and there hasn't
been for, what, a decade?

That is all. Thank you.
