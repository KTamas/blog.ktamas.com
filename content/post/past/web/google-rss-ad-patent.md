My friend [Chad Dickerson], the [exiting CTO] of Infoworld, has [blogged] about
a recent move by Google to patent advertising in RSS!

This despite the fact that InfoWorld was itself sending targeted ads out in is
RSS feeds *before Google filed for its patent!* Is this another [one-click
debacle] in the making? Does it really make any sense to patent delivering
targeted ads over HTTP just because they're in XML instead of HTML?

What do you think?
