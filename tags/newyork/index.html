<p>The year is 2016. It was a Monday, starting my second week of my first trip to New York in August, and I was sitting on the subway. I think I was just looking at my phone, not paying much attention to anything when suddenly, approaching a station, someone hands me a drawing. Of me.</p>
<p>I was flabbergasted; this guy just gave me a sketch of me, and an amazing one of that. I may have given him a dollar or two, then he got off the train.</p>
<p>I loved it so much that I took a picture of it; you may recognize it since it&rsquo;s the avatar I use everywhere on the internet for the past 4 years:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/41qnsTl.jpg" alt="Orin"></p>
<p>It was one of the coolest &ldquo;this is a <em>very</em> New York thing&rdquo; moments I had.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who this person was, and although he signed the image, it&rsquo;s hard to read and I didn&rsquo;t think much of it, so that was that.</p>
<hr>
<p>Three years later, <a href="https://writetogether.space/posts/ktamas/day-7-park-slope-and-beyond">I&rsquo;m in New York again, at the XOXO meetup</a> at the Lavender Lake bar, and somehow I was telling the story of how I got my avatar to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel</a>. He looks at the picture, notices the signature, starts googling and lo and behold, he finds this article: <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/orin-subway-sketch-artist-339991">Meeting This Artist Could Be the Best Thing to Happen to You on the Subway</a>. I encourage you to read it, but here are the first two paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For most New Yorkers, performers on the subway must be endured as part of our daily commutes. However, imagine my surprise this past weekend as I looked up from a conversation with my Tetris-engrossed boyfriend to see that there was a man with a sketchbook across from us, quietly drawing our portrait in broad strokes with a black marker.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That man is <a href="https://orinstudio.wordpress.com/">Orin</a>, and maybe you&rsquo;ve seen him, too. He told me he&rsquo;s drawn over 500,000 portraits of people on the subway, as part of a daily project he&rsquo;s been doing for the last 15 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, the article was written just two weeks before Orin drew my picture. This is not the only one about him, though: <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/watch-subway-artist-draw-incredible-3986561">here&rsquo;s one in the Mirror in 2014</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/06/nyregion/faster-than-a-speeding-train-artist-man.html">one in the New York Times way back from 2004</a>.</p>
<p>You can find more of his work on <a href="https://orinstudio.wordpress.com/">his website</a>. It was recently updated, and according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyc592/status/1060580399359901696">tweet from 2018</a>, he&rsquo;s still around, still drawing sketches of random New Yorkers. I hope he&rsquo;s well.</p>
